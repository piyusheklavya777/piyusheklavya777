### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for stopping by.

I am a professional software engineer since. Started my career in 2020.
I have worked extensively on Javascript / TypeScript, and familiar with golang.
I have worked with AWS services like lambda, SQS, Step functions etc. to build serverless architectures.
I also have experience with expressJS, used it to build server applications maintained with Docker and Kubernetes.

While you are here, maybe take a look at my work in pinned repositories.
