### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for stopping by.

I am a software engineer / back end developer, working since 2020.
I have worked on back end development extensively with Javascript / TypeScript, and am familiar with golang.
I have worked with AWS services like lambda, SQS, Step functions etc. to build serverless architectures.
I also have experience with expressJS, and have used it to build applications maintained with Docker and Kubernetes.

While you are here, maybe take a look at my work in pinned repositories.

# Collaborations
- I am looking to collaborate on any JS/TS projects.
- If you want to collaborate on my projects, take a look at search-service repository readme.
